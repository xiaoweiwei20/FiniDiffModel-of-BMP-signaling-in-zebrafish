# FiniDiffModel-of-BMP-signaling-in-zebrafish
uses a 1D finite difference method to solve the ODE for Zebrafish BMP gradient formation during embryogenesis including sizzled, bmp1a and tolloid. 
Based on the primary function FiniteTest.m for the evaluation of differential equations using the 4th order runge-kutta technique with a fixed step-size.
